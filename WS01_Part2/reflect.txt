Part 1 of workshop:
in part one 1 split the functions and their prototype in several modules. I move functions in their specific cpp files and send their prototype in header files. the challenge part is connecting these modules together, because after spliting modules sometimes there will be bug for modules to recognize each other. For example: the challenge I encountered was importing everal cpp modules in the one specific header and then import that header in the main cpp file.
There was several error that cpp file couldn't recognize variables in the header. the second problem was I should have known differences between global variable and constant values. At the first it was hard for me to recognize differences between global variable and cnstant values.
If you put all functions, prototypes, global variables and constant values in a single module it will be easier to understand how it works but there is not classification. after spliting and arrange them in different cpp modules it will be little harder to debug them. because dedbug reports are not so clear.

Part 2 of workshop:
Frankly part two workshop is easy. you just need to call functions that already given in cstring.cpp file then use the string functions in them. for example use string strcpy() function in strCpy() of module. 
The second part of workshop intends to teach you about different string function to use. strcpy() function to copy sencond string into first one, strncpy() function copies first string into second function with restricted length, strcmp() function will compare two strings and it will return 0 if they are same and return 1 if the first string is bigger and return -1 if the second string is bigger. strlen() gives you the length of the string, it doesn't consider '\0'. strcat() function concates the second string to the end of the first string.
