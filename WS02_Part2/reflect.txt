In this workshop I called struct named Population and then i put two parameter in it. postal_code and population. first parameter will get thre charecter of postal code and secon d one get population in int.

The overall concept is to read postal_code and population from csv fil then put them in object of struct then sum up the population of each objct and finally show the information.
In this regard, I have three cpp file with their headers. First: popReport file is the main cpp file which two other cpp files import in it. 

File module(cpp) has three funtion openFile, noOfRecords and closeFile. openFile call a File pointer and open the csv file, it return false if it can't open the file. noOfRecords will read a number of files, it recognizse number of files based on '\n' number. close file will close the fptr, if we forget to close the file it will be memory leak.

Next cpp file is Population. In this module I used functions of File module in it. In this module I hae five function named sort, load, display, deallocateMemory. In load function i used openFile function to open the file then used noOfRecords to have number of record and then I called array of objects of Population struct. After having all these objects then I give parameters of these objects as input for read function. read function will open the csv file and transfer data to the parameters of the object. 

Display function will show postal code and population of each objects then it sum up all population and show it. Inside display function there is a sort array and i sort objects based on the population then i cout them. At the end I call a deallocateMemory function to release all dynaic memory i used.
