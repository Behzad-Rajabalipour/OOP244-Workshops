This workshop was for operators. There were any lessons to learn in this workshop. First I learned how to use operators such as: operator+=(), operator=(), operator<<.
The second import lesson was overloading operators and friend operators. For example for operator+=() I had to use friend operator. First I thought like operator++() and operator++(int) I can use the same logic for operator+=() but it didn't work. So in order to put object after int I had to user friend operator. SO I used friend int operator+=(int number&, Account& obj){} to be able to put object next to the it and accumulate to the int. I also had challenge about working with operator bool() const{} and operator int() const. At the begining it was hard for me to understnd their function, after searching on google I understand we use bool operator in some situations like condition(if) and use int/double operator when we want to put object into int/double variable.
Although this workshop didn't have dynamic pointer but it was challenging.
