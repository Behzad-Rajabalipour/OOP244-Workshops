Workshop 3 part 2(DIY) is almost part one. Part two follow the same pattern part one does.
In this part we have callListTester as a main module then we use CalorieList module (both header and cpp file) to get the calory of foods item. In CalorieList module we have class with the same name which gets array of Food class objects with size of size member variable. We have m_addedItem membe variable which whenever e use add method to add new Food object to m_foodItems array we increse the m_addedItems. CalorieList object contins a array of Food objects and wih add method we add Food objects to this array. init method will determine size of this array. isValid method will determine whether each of object of this array has a valiable name, calory and time(when). if even one item of this array will be invalid then display method will give us Invalid Calorie Consumption List. IF all items of this array are coorect then display method will show Food name, Cals, When and Total Calories.
